# Ayobami Pase — IT Systems Engineer Portfolio

This is my personal IT portfolio website, focused on **enterprise IT systems engineering, systems administration, endpoint management, identity services, and reliable operational support**.

The site is deployed with **Netlify** and connected to a custom subdomain.

All site content is driven by a structured `resume.json` file that follows the  
[JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) open standard.

The application is built with **React** and styled using the **Bulma CSS framework**.
